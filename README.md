# Go/No-Go Task Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Go/No-Go psychological task using `pyactr`.

## Task Overview

- **Go Trials**: Indicated by the letter `'A'`.
- **No-Go Trials**: Indicated by the letter `'O'`.
- **Stimulus Duration**: Each stimulus is presented for 1000 ms.
- **Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI)**: A blank screen is displayed between stimuli.
- **Trial Distribution**: By default, 75% of the trials are Go trials, with a total of 125 trials.

Most task settings (e.g., trial count, Go probability, timings) are configurable within the script.

## Output

The simulation script produces ACT-R trace files in plain text format.

## Analysis

- Trace files (`.txt`) are converted into `.csv` files for analysis.
- **Reaction Time (RT)** is calculated as:

```
RT = time of keypress - time when Go stimulus is processed in the visual buffer
```

## Folder Structure

- `data/` - Main directory containing all output data.
- `raw/` - Contains raw `.txt` ACT-R trace files.
- `converted/` - Contains `.csv` files converted from raw traces.
- `RTs/` - Contains final `.csv` files with calculated RTs.

And that, dear mortals, concludes the README. Youâ€™re welcome.
